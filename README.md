# Fuzzy-Logic-Assigment
Fuzzy Logic air conditioner controller 

## Project description
Your goal for this assignment is to design and implement a Fuzzy Logic Air Conditioner controller
for the feedback system simulation shown below

The external disturbances in the control system shown above are room temperature and target
temperature. Target temperature can be set using a temperature dial and the Air Conditioner can
be switched on/off. When the Air Conditioner is switched off, the room temperature is only
affected by the outside temperature and it should track the outside temperature on the
temperature graph. When the Air Conditioner is switched on, the room temperature should track
the target temperature but it will still be affected by the outside temperature. For example, as the
outside temperature drops, the Air Conditioner would have to work harder to maintain a target
temperature of 18 degrees celsius.
